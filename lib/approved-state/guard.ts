/**
 * The approved state, checked again inside the transaction that acts
 * (finding KLEDG-R3-MCP-01).
 *
 * An MCP action approved by the user in validation mode is bound to the
 * rows the user saw (lib/mcp/full-control/fingerprint.ts). The MCP layer
 * compares them right before calling the service, but an edit could still
 * land between that comparison and the service's own transaction. So the
 * MCP layer runs the service inside `runWithApprovedState`, with the state
 * of every target as approved, and the services call `checkApprovedState`
 * inside their transaction, where they lock the row they are about to
 * change (lockInvoice, lockExpenseReport, the entry validation, the rule
 * application...). The check locks the target rows, reads them again and
 * throws ApprovedStateChangedError when they differ from the approved
 * state: the transaction rolls back and nothing is written.
 *
 * Outside an approved MCP execution (web pages, API, automatic mode) the
 * check does nothing.
 *
 * A target is checked once per execution (the first transaction that locks
 * it; the service then changes it itself), except rules: the rules engine
 * applies a rule many times without changing it, so every application
 * checks it again.
