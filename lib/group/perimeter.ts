/**
 * The perimeter of a group view: the holding and its subsidiaries (one
 * definition, lib/management-fees/holding.ts: the companies that record the
 * holding among their shareholders), split into those the user may read and
 * those they may not.
 *
 * Invariants owned here:
 * - every subsidiary is checked with the user's own role there
 *   (reports:read), through a GroupAccess: the web routes build it from the
 *   user's roles, the MCP tools from their company guard, which also applies
 *   the connection's company grant (lib/management-fees/access.ts);
 * - a subsidiary out of reach (not a member, outside an assistant's grant)
 *   is counted, never read: neither its name nor its id leaves the server;
 *   a subsidiary where the user's role is too low is named (the user is a
 *   member of it) and not read either;
 * - reads of a reachable subsidiary run in its own row level security
 *   scope (inCompany), never in a system context.
