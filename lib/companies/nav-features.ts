/**
 * Pages of the company navigation that only some companies need
 * (components/layout/nav-config.ts, NavItem.feature):
 * - training: an establishment of the company is an organisme de formation
 *   (Establishment.isTrainingOrganization): Bilan pédagogique et financier;
 * - vatCoefficient: the company deducts its VAT by a coefficient (exempt,
 *   partly exempt) or is a training organisation, whose training is exempt
 *   (CGI art. 261, 4, 4° a): Coefficient de déduction de TVA and Taxe sur
 *   les salaires (due by employers not subject to VAT on 90 % of their
 *   turnover, CGI art. 231).
 * The pages stay reachable by URL; the navigation only lists them where
 * they apply. Reads run in the user's own row level security context,
 * narrowed to the companies the caller listed.
