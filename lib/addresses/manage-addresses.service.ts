/**
 * Postal addresses of one company: search, read, create, the check that an
 * address may be attached to one of its records, and the clean-up of an
 * address a change left unused. Used by /api/addresses, company creation
 * (lib/companies/create-company.service.ts) and establishments
 * (lib/companies/manage-establishments.service.ts).
 *
 * Invariants owned here:
 * - every address belongs to one company (Address.companyId, required since
 *   migration 20261014090000_address_owner_company); every lookup is scoped
 *   by it, so another company's address is a 404 exactly like an address
 *   that does not exist, even one just created and not attached yet;
 * - a record of a company (its own address and headquarters, an
 *   establishment, a person) only points at an address of that company:
 *   attaching checks Address.companyId, so no address is shared across
 *   companies;
 * - creating an address reuses an identical address of the same company
 *   only, never another company's;
 * - replacing or removing a link deletes the old address in the same
 *   transaction when nothing refers to it any more (deleteAddressesIfUnused).
