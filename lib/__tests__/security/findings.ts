/**
 * Finding registry for the permanent attack test suite (lib/__tests__/security).
 *
 * Every security test that documents a weakness references a finding id here.
 * - status 'open': a weakness this suite found; its test is enabled when the
 *   behaviour is already safe (regression), or skipped (demonstrating the gap
 *   without hanging/failing CI) when a fix is still owed. The skip tag is the
 *   finding id so the test turns on once fixed.
 * - status 'delegated': a weakness already being fixed by another workstream
 *   (listed in the pentest brief). Its test asserts the expected-secure
 *   behaviour and is skipped with the finding id until that fix lands.
 * - status 'fixed': fixed together with its (enabled) test; `fixedIn` names
 *   the commit of the fix.
 *
 * CVSS vectors are 3.1 base scores, author estimate.
