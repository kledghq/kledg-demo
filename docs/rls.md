# Row level security (tenant isolation in PostgreSQL)

Kledg isolates companies in the application: every route resolves a company
through a resolver, checks the user's role (`lib/rbac/authorize.ts`) and
scopes every query by `companyId` ([conventions.md](conventions.md#api-routes)).
Row level security (RLS) repeats that guarantee in PostgreSQL, as defence in
depth for a hosted, multi-tenant Kledg: **a request acting for one user can
never read or write the rows of a company that user cannot reach, even if a
query forgets its `companyId` filter.**

RLS is rolled out behind `KLEDG_RLS`, while the policies always exist:

| `KLEDG_RLS` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `off` (default) | No context is sent, no overhead. The policies are in the database but let every role through until they are switched on (`pnpm db:rls-role`), and never apply to the table owner: existing installs, single-role or not, keep working unchanged. |
| `enforce` | The application connects as a role that is not the owner and has no `BYPASSRLS` (`kledg_app`). Every statement runs in a transaction that first sets the request's context; the policies filter every row. A role that would bypass the policies, or policies not switched on, are refused at the first query. |

Any other value stops the server at the first query: a typo must not
silently turn the protection off. An instance whose policy requires row level
security (`requiresRowLevelSecurity`, [extension-points.md](extension-points.md))
refuses to start, and to open the database, unless it is `enforce`.

## Threat model

What RLS protects against: application code that forgets a company filter
(`findUnique({ where: { id } })` on an id from the request, a report query
without `companyId`, a nested include reaching another company), raw SQL
written without a tenant predicate, a new route or tool that skips the
resolver. With `enforce`, such a query returns no row of another company and
cannot insert, update or delete one.

What it does not protect against:

- **SQL injection that runs arbitrary statements.** The context lives in
  transaction settings that the application role sets itself; injected SQL
  could set them too. Kledg has no string-built SQL (`sql-injection.test.ts`
  guards it); RLS is not a substitute.
- **The identity itself.** The database trusts the user id the application
  took from the session. A forged session is an authentication bug, not a
  tenant bug.
- **Instance administrators.** They reach every company by design
  (`isGlobalAdmin`); the database reads that status from `user.role`, never
  from the context.
- **Existence through unique constraints.** A unique index (company SIREN or
  slug, establishment SIRET, organization slug) still refuses a value another
  tenant holds. The value is not readable, only its existence. The SIREN,
  SIRET and slug checks go through `kledg_company_identifier_taken`, which
  answers that boolean and nothing else (`lib/companies/identifiers.ts`).
  An instance whose customers share the database narrows the SIREN and SIRET
  checks to the customer's own companies (`companyIdentifierScope`) and
  gives slugs a random suffix (`randomCompanySlugSuffix`), so no answer
  depends on another customer's companies
  ([extension-points.md](extension-points.md#company-identifiers)).
- **Subsidiaries of a holding.** The shareholder rows that make a company a
  subsidiary belong to the subsidiary. `kledg_group_subsidiary_ids` answers
  their company ids, and nothing else, for a holding the context reaches,
  so the group view can say that a subsidiary exists without reading it
  (`lib/management-fees/holding.ts`, [vue-groupe.md](vue-groupe.md)). A
  member of the holding learns the ids of its subsidiaries; the
  application checks access to each one and never returns an id it cannot
  reach.

## Tenancy model

The tenant is the **company**. A user reaches a company through a membership
(`member` row of the company's `organization`); an instance administrator
(`user.role = 'admin'`, not banned) reaches every company. This is the same
rule as `requireCompanyAccess`, evaluated in the database.

### Context

Each transaction carries these settings, set with
`set_config(name, value, true)` (transaction scoped):

| Setting | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kledg.access` | `user`, `system`, `anonymous` | Who acts. `user`: a signed-in user, an API key or an OAuth assistant acting for a user. `system`: a server job with no user (the bank sync cron, tests). `anonymous`: a request without a session (sign-in, password reset, setup). Empty: no context. |
| `kledg.user_id` | user id | The acting user (`user` only). |
| `kledg.company_scope` | PostgreSQL text array literal, or empty | Narrows the reachable companies, never widens them: the company grant of an AI assistant or API key, the company of a system job. Empty: no narrowing. `{}`: no company. |
| `kledg.reason` | text | The system job (`cron:bank-sync`...), for debugging only. |

The database computes what a context reaches with two functions, `STABLE`,
`PARALLEL SAFE` and `SECURITY DEFINER` (they read `user`, `member` and
`organization` as the owner, whatever the policies on those tables):

- `kledg_rls_unrestricted()`: true while the policies are switched off, for
  `system` without scope, and for an active instance administrator without
  scope.
- `kledg_rls_company_ids()`: the reachable company ids otherwise: the scope
  for `system` and administrators; for a user, the companies of their
  memberships intersected with the scope; nothing for `anonymous`, a banned
  or unknown user, or no context.

A company table's policy is

```sql
(SELECT kledg_rls_unrestricted()) OR "companyId" = ANY ((SELECT kledg_rls_company_ids())::text[])
```

The scalar subqueries make each function an *InitPlan*: evaluated once per
statement, not once per row, and `= ANY(array)` can use the `companyId`
indexes and parallel plans. Nothing is cached across statements: a
membership removed or a role changed applies to the next statement. A
malformed scope raises an error (fails closed).

### Why the database derives access from the user id

The other option was for the application to compute the allowed company ids
per request and pass them in a setting. It is cheaper (no membership lookup),
but the database would then trust a list that application code builds: a
bug there widens access silently. Deriving the companies in the database
from the user id means the application only asserts *who* acts; *what* that
user reaches is decided by the membership rows, the same ones the
application checks. The cost is one indexed lookup on `member(userId)` per
statement (tens of microseconds). The company scope keeps the narrowing
that only the application knows (an assistant's grant), and it can only
remove companies.

### The switch

`kledg_rls_enforced()` is an `IMMUTABLE` SQL function that returns `false`
after the migration: the policies then let every role through, so an
install whose application role is not the owner keeps working on upgrade.
`pnpm db:rls-role` replaces it with `SELECT true` (only the owner can).
Being immutable, it is folded into each plan and costs nothing.

## Policies

Every table of the `public` schema is in exactly one class below. The guard
test `lib/rls/__tests__/policy-coverage.db.test.ts` lists the tables of a
migrated database and fails on a table that has neither RLS with the four
policies nor an entry in the exemption list of `lib/rls/tables.ts`.

Each covered table has RLS enabled and four policies, `kledg_rls_select`,
`kledg_rls_insert`, `kledg_rls_update`, `kledg_rls_delete`: `USING` for reads,
updates and deletes, `WITH CHECK` for inserts and updates, so a row can be
neither read, created nor moved into a company outside the context.

`lib/rls/__tests__/policy-coverage.db.test.ts` checks more than the presence
of the four policies: every table with a `companyId` column belongs to a class
of `lib/rls/tables.ts` (or is listed with its class in the test), and the
`USING` and `WITH CHECK` expressions of every company scoped table are the
canonical `companyId` rule, so a migration that recreates a table with a
permissive policy (`USING (true)`) fails the suite.

| Class | Tables | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Company | `companies` (by `id`) | the company is reachable |
| Company scoped | `addresses`, `establishments`, `shareholders`, `fiscal_years`, `accounts`, `journals`, `accounting_entries`, `bank_connections`, `transaction_rules`, `integrations`, `import_jobs`, `fixed_assets`, `fixed_asset_depreciations`, `tax_regime_history`, `attachments`, `balance_sheet_line_configs`, `income_statement_line_configs`, `company_onboarding`, `tiers`, `invoices`, `expense_claimants`, `expense_reports`, `expense_category_rules`, `budgets`, `management_fee_conventions`, `management_fee_billings`, `subscription_decisions`, `provisions`, `provision_assessments`, `investment_grants`, `investment_grant_transfers`, `accounts_approvals`, `accounting_methods`, `accounting_changes`, `annexe_notes`, `simple_mode_entries`, `vat_return_filings`, `corporate_tax_returns`, `remuneration_scenarios`, `local_taxes`, `declaration_statuses`, `invoice_number_counters`, `vat_deduction_years`, `revenue_account_settings`, `training_reports`, `payroll_tax_years`, `company_invitations` | `companyId` is reachable |
| Company scoped, denormalized | `entry_lines`, `bank_transactions` | `companyId` is reachable; the column is set by a trigger from the parent row (below) |
| Through the parent | `bank_accounts` (connection), `bank_transaction_matches` (bank account), `transaction_rule_conditions`, `transaction_rule_entry_lines` (rule), `transaction_mappings` (connection), `integration_features`, `integration_resources`, `integration_sync_logs` (integration), `import_mappings` (import job), `balance_sheet_config_history`, `income_statement_config_history` (line config), `invoice_lines`, `invoice_vat_breakdowns`, `invoice_payments` (invoice), `expense_lines` (report), `budget_lines` (budget), `budget_line_amounts`, `budget_recurring_items` (line), `management_fee_subsidiaries` (convention) | `EXISTS` on the parent, which applies the parent's own policy |
| Company and user | `dashboard_layouts`, `sidebar_preferences`, `mcp_confirmations`, `mcp_pending_actions` | the company is reachable and the row is the user's (or the context is unrestricted); a pending action without company (`create_company`, migration `20261111090000_mcp_actions_without_company`) is its user's only |
| User | `ai_access_grants`, `user_preferences` | `userId` is the acting user, or the context is unrestricted |
| Grant companies | `ai_access_grant_companies` | read and delete when the grant is visible (the user's own); insert and update also need the company reachable, so a user cannot grant an assistant a company they do not belong to |
| Membership | `organization` (company reachable), `member` (own membership, or organization visible), `invitation` (organization visible) | reads as stated; writes only for an unrestricted context (instance administrators, system), except that a user may delete their own membership |
| Optional company | `audit_logs` (company reachable; rows without company are instance events: any context writes them, only unrestricted contexts read them), `persons` (company reachable, or no company and a shareholder of a reachable company), `balance_sheet_config_templates`, `income_statement_config_templates` (company reachable, or a public template without company; only an unrestricted context writes a row without company: shared templates are Kledg's own, a company's template stays its own, KLEDG-R3-AUTHZ-01) | as stated |
| Exempt | `user`, `session`, `auth_account`, `verification`, `apikey`, `jwks`, `oauthClient`, `oauthResource`, `oauthClientResource`, `oauthRefreshToken`, `oauthAccessToken`, `oauthConsent`, `oauthClientAssertion`, `rateLimit`, `update_connection`, `instance_versions`, `_prisma_migrations` | no tenant data; see below |

An `INSERT ... RETURNING` must also pass the select policy: audit rows
without company are therefore written with `createMany` (no `RETURNING`).

### Child tables: `EXISTS` or a denormalized `companyId`

A child row without `companyId` is reachable when its parent is: the policy
is `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM parent WHERE parent.id = child."parentId")`, and the
parent's own policy applies inside the subquery. It needs no schema change
and cannot drift.

PostgreSQL does not turn a sublink of a policy into a join: it runs as a
correlated subplan, once per row the query reads. Measured on the benchmark
dataset (`scripts/bench`, large profile, 316 608 entry lines), the trial
balance query of the largest company went from 38 ms without RLS to 167 ms
with an `EXISTS` policy on `entry_lines` (one primary key probe per line,
41 142 times, and no parallel plan), and to 47 ms with a `companyId` column
on the line. So the two large tables read by reports and lists,
`entry_lines` and `bank_transactions`, carry a `companyId` maintained by the
database:

- `kledg_rls_entry_line_company` (`BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF
  "accountingEntryId", "companyId"` on `entry_lines`) copies the entry's
  company;
- `kledg_rls_bank_transaction_company` (same on `bank_transactions`, with
  `"bankAccountId"`) copies the company of the account's connection;
- moving a parent to another company (`accounting_entries."companyId"`,
  `bank_accounts."bankConnectionId"`, `bank_connections."companyId"`)
  recomputes the children in the same statement.

The application never writes the column (`@ignore` in the Prisma schema); a
value sent anyway is overwritten. The other children are small or read a
few rows at a time, where the per row subplan costs microseconds, and keep
`EXISTS`.

### Exempt tables

Better Auth's tables are read before any identity exists: sign-in looks a
user up by email, a session by its token, an API key by its hash, an OAuth
token by its value. A policy there would need a context that Better Auth
itself establishes, and protects nothing that the secret in the lookup does
not already protect. They hold no accounting data. `rateLimit` holds
counters keyed by IP or user, `update_connection` the instance's GitHub
connection and `instance_versions` its update history (instance
administrators only, checked by the route).
`_prisma_migrations` belongs to the migration tool (the application role
gets no right on it). The application reads the applied migrations (the
update history recorded at server start, the "Mises à jour" page) through
`kledg_applied_migrations()` (migration
`20261203090000_migration_history_reader`, `lib/updates/migration-history.ts`):
a `SECURITY DEFINER` function owned by the migration role that returns the
name and end time of the migrations finished and not rolled back, nothing
else. Its `EXECUTE` stays with `PUBLIC`, so an existing instance gets it with
`prisma migrate deploy`, without running `pnpm db:rls-role` again.

### Triggers and integrity functions

Triggers run as the role of the statement, so with RLS they would only see
the rows of the context: the closed fiscal year lock, the validated entry
guard and the company deletion guard would read nothing for a row they
cannot see, and let the change through. The migration makes them
`SECURITY DEFINER` with a fixed `search_path`, so integrity checks see every
row whatever the context. Foreign key checks and cascades already run as the
table owner. Later integrity triggers are created `SECURITY DEFINER` in their
own migration (`kledg_lock_closed_year_adjustments`, which keeps the
provision assessments and grant transfers of a closed year unchanged), and
listed in `DEFINER_TRIGGER_FUNCTIONS` (`lib/rls/tables.ts`).

### `ENABLE` without `FORCE`

`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` would apply the policies to the table owner too.
The owner runs the migrations: every future data migration (backfills,
`UPDATE` of existing rows) would then see no row and silently do nothing,
and every single-role install would lose its data at once. So the policies
apply to every role except the owner (and superusers), and `enforce`
requires the application to connect as another role: at the first query it
checks that the role is not a superuser, has no `BYPASSRLS`, does not own
the tables and that the policies are switched on, and refuses every query
otherwise.

## Roles

| Role | Used by | Rights |
|---|---|---|
| Owner (the role of `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`, else `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`) | `prisma migrate deploy`, `pnpm db:rls-role` | owns the schema |
| `kledg_app` (or the name given to `pnpm db:rls-role -- --role`) | the application with `KLEDG_RLS=enforce` (`KLEDG_DATABASE_URL`, else `DATABASE_URL`) | `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` on the tables, sequences and functions; no DDL, no `BYPASSRLS`, nothing on `_prisma_migrations` (it reads applied migrations through `kledg_applied_migrations()`), no `EXECUTE` on the owner-only `SECURITY DEFINER` functions (`kledg_purge_audit_logs`, `kledg_assert_fiscal_year_open`) |

`pnpm db:rls-role` (`scripts/rls-role.ts`) creates the role if needed, grants
it the rights above on the existing tables and, through `ALTER DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES`, on the tables future migrations create, then switches the
policies on. It is idempotent; `--off` switches the policies off again.
Setup per host: [self-hosting.md](self-hosting.md#isolation-des-sociétés-dans-la-base-rls).

## Context propagation

The context is held per request in an `AsyncLocalStorage`
(`lib/rls/context.ts`). The database layer (`lib/rls/pool.ts`) applies it to
the PostgreSQL connection, so every query of the request carries it: Prisma
model calls, `$queryRaw` and `$executeRaw`, interactive and batch
transactions, and Better Auth (which goes through the same Prisma client).

| Entry point | Context |
|---|---|
| `companyRoute`, `authedRoute`, `adminRoute` (`lib/api/route.ts`) | the signed-in user, from the company resolver to the handler; the session lookup itself runs as `anonymous` |
| Server components and server actions | derived from the session cookie of the request on the first statement without a context, once per request (`lib/rls/request-context.ts`) |
| MCP (`lib/mcp/auth.ts`) | the user of the API key or OAuth token, then narrowed to the connection's company grant for the tools |
| Crons (`lib/banking/sync-banks.service.ts`) | `system`, reason `cron:bank-sync`, after the `CRON_SECRET` check: the integrations are listed unscoped, then each company's sync runs narrowed to that company and writes an audit row in it |
| Automatic period closing (`lib/accounting/period-lock/auto-lock.service.ts`) | `system`, reason `cron:period-lock`, after the `CRON_SECRET` check: the companies are listed unscoped, then each company in monthly mode is locked narrowed to that company |
| Secret rotation (`lib/crypto/reencrypt.ts`, at server start) | `system`, reason `secret-rotation`, only while an older auth secret is configured: the sealed credentials of every company (bank connections, integrations, GitHub token) are read and sealed again with the current key, under an advisory lock; also the count of values still in the legacy format (`countLegacySecrets`: at server start, on the Configuration page of instance administrators and in `pnpm secrets:reencrypt`), which reads the format only |
| Invitation page (`lib/rbac/company-invitations.service.ts`) | `system`, reason `invitation-acceptance`: the invitee is not a member yet and may have no session, so the invitation is found by the SHA-256 of the token of its link (an unguessable secret), then, once the accepting account is established (signed in with the invited address, or created from the link), the membership is written (a `member` row, which only unrestricted contexts write) and the invitation closed. Nothing else is read |
| Receipt storage migration (`lib/receipts/migrate-receipt-storage.service.ts`, `pnpm receipts:migrate-storage` or `KLEDG_STORAGE_MIGRATE=on` at server start) | `system`, reason `storage-migration`: the receipt files of every company that are not on the configured storage driver are read, checked against their SHA-256, written to the configured storage and switched in one conditional update (`receipt_files` only; [configuration.md](configuration.md#stockage-des-justificatifs)) |
| Update history (`lib/updates/history.ts`, at server start) | `system`, reason `version-history`, only when the running version differs from the last recorded one: reads the instance's `UPDATES_MERGE` audit rows (no company, so only an unrestricted context reads them) to attribute the new version to the administrator who installed it, and writes the `instance_versions` row |
| Removal of a member, or leaving a company (`lib/rbac/remove-member.service.ts`) | `system`, reason `member-removal`, once the route or MCP tool checked the user's access in their own context; inside the transaction, under an advisory lock of the company's members, [the removal rules](membres-et-invitations.md#retrait-dun-membre) are applied first, then the member rows of the removed user, their sessions' active organization, their grants on the company (`ai_access_grant_companies`), their pending AI actions there (`mcp_pending_actions`) and the open invitations they sent are rows of another user, which only an unrestricted context writes; so is the audit entry, which a member who left could no longer write in their own context |
| Company creation by a user (`lib/companies/create-company.service.ts`) | `system`, reason `company-creation`, only when the instance policy lets a user who is not an instance administrator create a company (`companyCreationRefusal`, [extension-points.md](extension-points.md#company-creation)): the company has no member yet, and its organization and the creator's membership are writes that only an unrestricted context may do. Kledg's default policy never takes this path |
| Better Auth (`/api/auth/*`) | derived from the session cookie when there is one, else `anonymous`; its own tables are exempt |
| Setup (`/setup`) | `anonymous` (only Better Auth tables are written) |
| Scripts and seeds | `system` with reason `script` (`withSystemContext`) |
| Instance extensions (forks, the demo) | `withSystemContext('instance-extension', fn, { companyIds })` or `withUserContext(userId, fn)`, from `lib/rls/context.ts` ([extension-points.md](extension-points.md#row-level-security)) |

`withUserContext`, `withSystemContext`, `withAnonymousContext` and
`runWithRlsContext` start a returned Prisma promise inside the context:
Prisma's promises are lazy, and awaiting one outside the callback would run
its query without the context.

System contexts are listed: `SystemReason` (`lib/rls/context.ts`) is a closed
union, every use is logged at `info` with its reason, and
`lib/rls/__tests__/system-context-usage.test.ts` fails when a file outside the
documented list calls `withSystemContext`.

### Deriving a context from the request

The derivation reads the session row by its token itself, with one query on
the exempt `session` table: it never calls Better Auth, whose adapter state
(a transaction it is opening) may belong to the very statement being
derived. The token is the secret Better Auth checks too; the cookie's
signature only saves Better Auth a lookup for forged values, which find no
row here. Banned users are refused by the database (`kledg_rls_company_ids`).
Statements on exempt tables only (the session lookup of every request) run
without deriving anything.

### Applying the context to a connection

Neon's pooled URL goes through PgBouncer in transaction mode: a session
setting (`SET`, `set_config(..., false)`) would stay on a server connection
that the next transaction, of another tenant, may get. Only a setting local
to a transaction is safe, so with `enforce` **every statement runs inside a
transaction that starts by setting the context**:

- a statement outside a transaction (most Prisma reads) becomes
  `BEGIN; SELECT set_config(...)` (one round trip), the statement, `COMMIT`:
  two round trips more than without RLS. A statement on exempt tables only
  runs as it is;
- a transaction (`$transaction`, Prisma's own for nested writes) holds its
  `BEGIN` back and sends `BEGIN; SELECT set_config(...)` in front of its first
  statement: no round trip more. A first statement
  `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL ...` becomes `BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL ...`;
  an empty transaction sends nothing.

The context is read when the statement or the connection is requested, in
the caller's async context, never later from a pool callback that may run
for another request. The context of a transaction is the one active when it
starts; a context entered inside a transaction callback applies to the next
transaction only.

Prisma merges the `findUnique` calls of the same shape issued in the same
tick into one query, dispatched from the context of the first call: two
concurrent requests could share it. With `enforce`, `lib/rls/batching.ts`
turns that batching off outside transactions, so each lookup runs in its own
caller's context (the isolation test reproduces the leak without it).

### Missing context

With `enforce`, a statement outside any context (no request, no
`withSystemContext`) runs with empty settings: the policies return no row,
and the database layer refuses writes (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`,
`TRUNCATE`, `COPY`, or a CTE containing one) with an error before they are
sent. Inside a request, a missing session is the `anonymous` context, which
reaches no company.

## Performance

See the benchmark table in the CHANGELOG entry and in the pull request:
`scripts/bench` (large profile: 21 companies, 115 048 entries, 316 608 lines,
160 000 bank transactions; local PostgreSQL 17) with `KLEDG_RLS=off` and
`enforce`. Report and list queries keep their plans (the company filter is
an InitPlan on an indexed column). Each statement outside a transaction
costs two more round trips, which matters more on a remote database (about
a millisecond each from Vercel to Neon in the same region) than locally.

## Tests

| Test | Checks |
|---|---|
| `lib/rls/__tests__/policy-coverage.db.test.ts` | every table has RLS and its four policies, or is exempt with a reason; no `FORCE`; the integrity functions are `SECURITY DEFINER`; every `SECURITY DEFINER` function has `search_path = public, pg_temp`, and only the ones the application calls are executable by its role and `PUBLIC`; the policies call the access functions as InitPlans |
| `lib/rls/__tests__/tenant-isolation.db.test.ts` | with user A's context, raw SQL and Prisma cannot read, insert, update, delete or move rows of company B in every covered table; no context and the anonymous context read nothing; writes without context are refused; scopes narrow and never widen; administrators and system contexts reach everything; banned and unknown users nothing; the denormalized `companyId` cannot be forged; concurrent lookups of two users are never batched together; switched off, every role passes |
| `lib/rls/__tests__/pool.db.test.ts` | context per statement and per transaction, captured at call time, deferred `BEGIN`, isolation levels, empty transactions, refusal of writes without context, refusal of a bypassing role |
| `lib/rls/__tests__/sql.test.ts` | settings, escaping, statement classification, `KLEDG_RLS` parsing |
| `lib/rls/__tests__/system-context-usage.test.ts` | `withSystemContext` only in the documented places |
| The whole suite with `KLEDG_RLS=enforce` | `lib/__tests__/helpers/test-db.ts` creates the `kledg_app_test` role, switches the policies on and connects the application as that role; rows that tests write or read directly, outside a request, go through the `system` context; requests go through their real context; migration tests replay their SQL as the owner (`queryAsOwner`), as `prisma migrate deploy` does |

Run the suite under RLS:

```bash
KLEDG_RLS=enforce KLEDG_REQUIRE_TEST_DB=1 KLEDG_TEST_DB_PREFIX=kledg_rls \
KLEDG_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://kledg:kledg@localhost:55432/kledg_test pnpm test:run
```

Route tests that mock the signed-in user must give it its membership in the
database too (`seedMembership`, `lib/__tests__/helpers/membership.ts`): the
database, not the mock, decides what the user reaches.

## Enabling it on an existing instance

1. Upgrade: the migration adds the functions, the policies and the
   denormalized columns. Nothing changes while `KLEDG_RLS` is `off`.
2. Create the application role and switch the policies on, with the owner's
   connection: `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL=<owner url> pnpm db:rls-role -- --password <secret>`.
3. Give the application that role: `KLEDG_DATABASE_URL` (it comes before
   `DATABASE_URL`, which a host integration such as Neon on Vercel may
   manage and which then keeps the owner's URL), or `DATABASE_URL` itself
   with the owner in `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` for migrations. Set
   `KLEDG_RLS=enforce`, redeploy.
4. To go back: `KLEDG_RLS=off` and remove `KLEDG_DATABASE_URL` (the owner is
   never subject to the policies), or `pnpm db:rls-role -- --off`.
